# NeueTab
 Neue Tab is a start page inspired by command-line applications like Neofetch (rip). It is currently in alpha state.
## Features(For Now)
- Looks like Neofetch if you squint really hard
- Clock
- Date
- Links
- Search Bar
## Installation
Don't. But for the sake of documentation:
1. Clone the repository.
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/httpsbayleaf/NeueTab
  ```
2. Run using Firefox.
(I use XAMPP to host the file locally, since New Tab Override doesn't let you do local files. You can modify the code to do all the styles and scripts in-line, but I'm not gonna do that.)
